# pdf-viewer
This is an application that reads pdf file and present it in a nice, paged way. This way one can read pdf files the same way as going through presentation, changing slides with arrow keys. The application was written using Visual Studio C++ 2017 and Windows API and may be run only on Windows platform. Gtest/gmock was used in order to unit-test the code.
